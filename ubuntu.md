Just Some Documentation to bootstrap my ubuntu installations. In general I reinstall a fresh version of Ubuntu the latest Ubuntu LTS every 6-12 months. While it is possible to write an Ansible Playbook or autoinstall.yaml, I prefer to run a series of bash commands, which is normally partially scripted.
- neofetch
- vim
- vscode
- sublime
- Docker
- MySQL server
- python-is-python3
- git
pip
These packages are for interactive sessions, for projects I would use a venv with a requirements.txt
- pandas
- sklearn
- tensorflow
- sqlalchemy
- openpyxl
vscode plugins

etc
- I run a network attached storage from my raspberry pi to stream media to devices on my home network.
