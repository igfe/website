By implementing CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and cloud automation, businesses reduce downtime, improve security posture, and enable rapid innovation. Without DevOps, AI models remain trapped in research notebooks rather than production-ready systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During my time at SpatialEdge, I was thrown in the deep end as a contractor for the big data operations team of one of the largest telecommunications provider in South Africa. While it is hard to define what we do as a team in a single sentence, we use administrator privilege to solve all issues that do not specifically fall in the domain of other teams. If there is a production incident at 3am, a team representative will certainly be on a call. While my team is responsible for maintaining a wide array of technologies, mostly the installation, initial setup, and maintenance thereof, our key technologies are the following:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Machine Learning Engineering</title><link>https://ignaz.io/fields/ml-engineering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ignaz.io/fields/ml-engineering/</guid><description>&lt;p>ML Engineering operationalizes AI by developing, deploying, and monitoring machine learning models at scale. This includes feature engineering, model serving, and MLOps practices to ensure AI solutions remain accurate, explainable, and compliant. Without ML Engineering, businesses risk stale models, biased predictions, and regulatory non-compliance.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
